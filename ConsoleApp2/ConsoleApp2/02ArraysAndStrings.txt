1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
String is immutable in C#.If you want to modify a string, go with StringBuilder. StringBuilder represents a mutable string.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
System.Array

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
Array.Sort()

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
Length

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
Yes, we can store multiple data types in a System.Array by creating an array of System.Object, since Object is the base class for all data types in C#. 

6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
CopyTo() method: It is used to copy the elements from one array to another existing array starting at the specified index. 
It requires the destination array to be already initialized.
Clone() method: It creates a shallow copy of the array, meaning it creates a new array and copies the elements into it. 
If the array contains reference types, then only the references are copied, not the actual objects.
Clone() returns an Object.
